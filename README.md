# aggregateRating-Schema-Generator
a tool for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) professionals to create aggregateRating schema

I began working on this tool on March 2, 2019 and first uploaded draft #1 to GitHub on March 3, 2019 at 11:30pm. I intend to publish this tool on my blog, https://supertechnicalseo.com. There are still many bugs to work through, including form validation and getting all of the inputs into the output.
